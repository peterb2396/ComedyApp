add tabs: "Comedian to me" and "Me to comedian" (default)


All sorting / filtering will stay on frontend. Backend will limit results when implementing pagination, and will need page param
pagination ... eventually. Simple, just only return a range of results from DB. No change in rendering on frontend!

Add bookmark feature: database, or local storage? require login?
Comedian page: View description, video, etc
Accounts: just for comedians? We would (probably) need accounts for users to leave reviews.
- We couuuuuld allow anonymous reviews. Less account overhead. More spam reviews. 
- Make them be logged in to bookmark? Or if logged out, use local storage, if logged in, use db?

Login page: Ask if they are a comedian or a user. Show a different form. Design it so we can show the same form to change account information,
but gray out the email and password because these cannot be changed. Add forgot password on login
Login -> credentials or forgot password or signup instead
Signup -> comedian or user or signup instead

** use bootstrap tabs for comedian / user signup? **

Implement sorting. Arrays.sort.. ?
Image upload: s3 bucket? nudity api?


- dropdown menu
- experience instead of compatibility
- image for each comedian (aws s3)
- calendar system
