Remove go button from first zip page? Need to auto-search on entry always (instead of ignoring first, like now)


add tabs: "Comedian to me" and "Me to comedian" (default)


All sorting / filtering will stay on frontend. Backend will limit results when implementing pagination, and will need page param
pagination ... eventually. Simple, just only return a range of results from DB. No change in rendering on frontend!
